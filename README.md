- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanielRainer3
- 👀 I’m interested in materials science and data evaluation.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a PhD student in materials chemistry in Uppsala (Sweden). The focus of my work lays on additive manufacturing of rare-earth-free permanent magnets.
- 💞️ I would be open to collaborate on data evaluation of microstructural data of various kinds of materials. The application of machine learning in materials science would interest me a lot.
- 📫 You can reach me via my university address daniel.rainer@kemi.uu.se
